# Password Generator

## In the modern day of hacking and cybersecurity, having a simple password generator can mean the difference between your data being secure, and your secret recipes being leaked all over Pintrest. This generator was missing a function that was required to actually generate the password, and it has now been added. 

# Installation

## N/A 

# Usage

## Once you click on the Generate Password button, a prompt should pop up that asks you how long your password should be. Enter a number between 8-128 to determine the length of your password. If a number outside of those parameters is inserted, an error will occur.

## After that, four questions will pop up that ask whether or not you'd like uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in your password.
